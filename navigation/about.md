### Culture, Family, and Fun

Everything for me, as for many others, revolves around Family.

- Both my parents were born in India, but my dad moved to Texas, and later my mom joined him. They later moved to San Diego where I was born.
- My immediate family is pretty small, only consisting of my parents and me. I have 3 first cousins, one on my dad's side, and two on my mom's side.
- For fun, I like to play sports and excercise. I play soccer competetively and I also play basketball sometimes. For excercise I like to go on runs, and workout at home.

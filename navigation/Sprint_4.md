### Code Changed:

#### Explanation: 
I worked with the width and height percentage, changing how much of the sprite's height and width would actually register in a collision (aka the hitbox). Originally, the sprite appeared to be floating, which wasn't visually pleasing. Many popular games have precise hitboxes that reflect the game's quality. Changing the hitbox shows attention to detail and gives the player a satisfactory experience.

### Background:
**Original:**

**After:**

#### Explanation: 
The original background was blurry and lacked detail. Additionally, it didn't add much meaning to the game. The new background is clearer and provides context for the level's story. For example, the robot enemy in the background might have destroyed the buildings and is now attacking the sprite. This change gives the player a more engaging and imaginative experience.

## What I Want to Do Next:

### Level Finish:
Currently, all the games finish by going through an object (in our level, itâ€™s the toilet). However, I want to change this so that you have to collect all the coins to proceed to the next level.

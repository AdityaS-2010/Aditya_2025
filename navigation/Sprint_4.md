### Code Changed:

#### Explanation: 
I worked with the width and height percentage, changing how much of the sprite's height and width would actually register in a collision aka the hitbox. Originally the sprite appeared to be floating which wasn't visually pleasing. Lots of popular games we enjoy have pretty accurate hitboxes which reflect on the quality of the whole game its self. Changing the hitbox shows the attention to detail and gives the player satisfactory.

### Background:
Original:

After:

#### Explanation: 
The original background is clearly blurry and doesn't have much detail. Additionally it doesn't add much meaning to the game. This new background implemented into the game is more clear, and gives space for the level's story. For example the robot enemy in the background could've destroyed the buildings in the background and is now attacking the sprite. This change gives the player a more thoughtful experience leaving room for imagination.

## What I want to do next:

### Level Finish:
Currently all the games finish by going through an object, in our level it is the toilet. However I want to change this so that you have to collect all the coins to get to the next level instead.

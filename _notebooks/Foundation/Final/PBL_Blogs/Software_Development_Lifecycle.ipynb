    "Branching is a feature of version control systems that allows developers to create separate lines of development within a repository. Branches enable developers to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation from the main codebase. Once the work is complete, branches can be merged back into the main branch.\n",

The build process may also include tasks such as running automated tests, code analysis, and packaging the application for deployment.\n"

This includes writing and running automated tests, such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

    "A pull request is a mechanism for proposing changes to a codebase in a collaborative development environment.
